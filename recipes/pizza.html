    <h2>Pizza Night With 5 Clever Gluten Free Pizza Crusts</h2>
    <p>DIf you refrain from grain, but can't go without pizza...you've got to try this version with a 1-ingredient crust
        made just from cheese.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe turns the cheese on the pizza into the crust itself. So genius. Watch the video to see how easy it is
        to make with a non-stick pan. Top it any way you want, but use a light touch so the thin crust doesn't fall
        apart.

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot
            skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a
            "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for
            1 minute before slicing.
